Flow creation:
Steps are selected - in this phase, input will be enforced to be correct.
A flowConfigFile is created - this file contains the steps and the input set at creation for each step.
The actual values for the variables defined beforehand will be entered at runtime.

Flow execution:
The flowConfigFile is parsed and the steps are executed in the order they are defined.
The flowRunFile will be created - basically a config file with the missing values for each step,
and the runtime errors caught during execution.
Flow outputs will contain few selected steps and will go into their respective folder.
